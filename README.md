# Learning TypeScript / TypeScript with React

I'm venturing into the world of TypeScript, learning the basics before I combine it with React. In this journey, I'm leveraging my existing JavaScript knowledge and applying it to TypeScript.





I'm navigating through learning TypeScript by:

- Following this YouTube video: [TypeScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlxcujsvcIY) and using the TypeScript docs for further clarification.
- Writing notes to explain the code that the YouTube video is going through using a mix of comments and code.
- Converting these TypeScript files into Markdown documents so myself and others will be able to easily read and follow my notes.

The topics I have covered so far are:

- [TypeScript Types](./ts-for-beginners/TYPES.md)
- [TypeScript Functions](./ts-for-beginners/FUNCTIONS.md)
- [TypeScript Type Aliases](./ts-for-beginners/ALIASES.md)
- [TypeScript Interfaces](./ts-for-beginners/INTERFACES.md)
- [TypeScript Generics](./ts-for-beginners/GENERICS.md)
