# Learning TypeScript / TypeScript with React

I'm venturing into the world of TypeScript, learning the basics before combining it with React. In this journey, I'm leveraging my existing JavaScript knowledge and applying it to TypeScript.

I'm navigating through learning TypeScript by:

- Following this YouTube video: [TypeScript Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlxcujsvcIY) and using the TypeScript documentation for further clarification.
- Writing notes to explain the code that the YouTube video is going through using a mix of comments and code.
- Converting these TypeScript files into Markdown documents so both myself and others can easily read and follow my notes.

The topics I have covered are:

### Vanilla TypeScript Basics

- [TypeScript Types](./ts-for-beginners/TYPES.md)
- [TypeScript Functions](./ts-for-beginners/FUNCTIONS.md)
- [TypeScript Type Aliases](./ts-for-beginners/ALIASES.md)
- [TypeScript Interfaces](./ts-for-beginners/INTERFACES.md)
- [TypeScript Generics](./ts-for-beginners/GENERICS.md)

### TypeScript with React

As I proceed to embrace TypeScript within the context of React, I have chosen to navigate through an extensive [React-TypeScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwi1AXijGTKM0BKtHzVC-LSK). This deliberate approach ensures a comprehensive grasp of the fundamentals.

The topics I have covered are:

- [Passing Strings as Props](./react-ts/react-ts-notes/PROPS.md)
- [Passing Various Data Types as Props](./react-ts/react-ts-notes/PROPTYPES.md)
